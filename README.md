# **PandoraBox Game Store**  
  

I have built this project for understanding the concepts of RxJS and Redux Observable.
  
  

**I used**  
  

- Plain CSS and React.js for UI  
  

- RxJS for blocking the user from spamming to the submit button and taking the data from input fields through listening users events  
  

- Redux Observable as middleware for side effects and triggering another actions  
  

- Webpack for bundling  
  

- Babel for compiling javascript compatible for older browsers
